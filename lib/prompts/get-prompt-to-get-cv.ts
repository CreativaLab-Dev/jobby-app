### üß† Guidelines
- Detect the **language** automatically from the CV content.
- Infer the **opportunityType** from context (e.g., mentions of ‚ÄúBeca‚Äù, ‚ÄúInternship‚Äù, ‚ÄúFellowship‚Äù).
- Always produce **valid JSON** (no markdown, no comments, no explanations).
- If information is missing, return an empty string or null for that field.
- Ensure all text values use proper case and formatting for storage.

Now analyze and process the following CV text:
${cvText}
